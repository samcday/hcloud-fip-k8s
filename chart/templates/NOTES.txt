The controller is now deployed. In the next few moments, it will begin managing the assignment of floating IPs
matching the label "{{ required "floating IP selector required" .Values.floatingIP.selector }}". You can see a list of those by running something like this:

$ hcloud floating-ip list -l {{ .Values.floatingIP.selector }}
